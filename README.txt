The purpose of this project is to parse GPS data and render it as an image, i.e. to draw a map!

Please see the individual notebooks for a more detailed explanation of what they do. 

The first notebook parses data from a KML file, which is the file format used by Google maps. 

Note: I'm referring to the custom maps that you can create, not the Google maps API. 
There have been a lot of changes to Google maps recently so some of this work might be outdated. 

The second notebook ingests GPS data and renders an image by drawing polygons.
